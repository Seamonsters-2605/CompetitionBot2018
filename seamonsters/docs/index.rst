Welcome to the seamonsters library documentation!
=================================================

This is Team 2605's Python library for robot code. It builds on wpilib and adds
useful utilities for working with input, motors, drivetrains, and Commands, as
well as for simulation without a robot and for quick and simple tests.

Terminology
-----------
In the documentation you will see the terms "position mode", "incremental 
position mode", and "jeff mode" used interchangeably. "Voltage mode" is used to
refer either to Voltage or PercentVbus mode on CANTalons. Also, some classes use
"velocity" in method/variable names while others use "speed."
